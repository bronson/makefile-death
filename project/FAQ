FAQ:

Q: Why create your own variables (CFLAGS_debug += -DABC) when gmake provides
target-specific variables (debug: CFLAGS += -DABC)?

A: Because you may want to use a particular configuration's variables
outside of a particular target.  The coupling is just too tight.
So, even though the gmake's implementation of target-specific variables
is quite good (CFLAGS += -DABC; config: CFLAGS += -DDEF works perfectly),
the Makefile Engine doesn't use them.
