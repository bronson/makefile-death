There are two ways to handle configuring each configuration:

- Use target-specific variables and a unique target for each configuation.
  (Surprisingly, CFLAGS += -DABC; config: CFLAGS += -DDEF works perfectly)
- Use variables (CFLAGS_debug) and a common set of targets.

I chose to use the latter because build commands are hard to write.
I can imagine that maintainability gets even worse if I'm trying to
dupe them for each target.
