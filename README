Advantages
- Full dependency handling, no phantom rebuilds.
- Can keep different configurations simultaneously: debug, test, release, etc.
- Can build source on a read-only medium: OBJDIR=/tmp/obj


Thoughts

Q: Why create custom variables (CFLAGS_debug += -DABC) when gmake provides
target-specific variables (debug: CFLAGS += -DABC) that should do the same
thing?

A: Because sometimes you need to access a configuration's variables
outside of its context.  gmake doesn't offer any way to do this.
