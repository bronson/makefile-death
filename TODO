- Make 'make debug' work (instead of current 'make CONFIG=debug').
- Add tmtest tests.  Move the obscure crap out to the tmtests.
  Make the Makefile shipped with the project simple and work in-place.
- Prettify the displayed output.
- Make sure we works with spaces in base paths or file paths.
- Can I clean up submodules?  Calculating BASE is pretty hackish.
- put scripts dir in a submodule so you can easily add just them?
- Write a converter for Visual Studio projects?
- What about filename collisions?
- Add targets or docs for lex, yacc, re2c, etc?
- Is there any way to disable builtin rules from the makefile itself?
